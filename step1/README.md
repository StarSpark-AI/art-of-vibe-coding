# Step 1: Hello World of Vibe Coding - Recipe Sharing App

Welcome to your first vibe coding experience! In this step, you'll use Claude Code to generate a complete React application for sharing recipes with a waitlist signup homepage.

## What You'll Build

A simple recipe sharing web application with:
- Homepage with waitlist signup form
- Clean, modern design
- Basic recipe sharing functionality
- Responsive layout

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed and authenticated
- Cursor IDE or VS Code ready
- Basic familiarity with terminal/command line

---

## Instructions

### 1. Launch Claude Code

From this step1 directory, start Claude Code in interactive mode:

```bash
claude
```

### 2. Generate the Recipe Sharing App

Use this prompt with Claude Code to generate your React application:

```
Create a React web application for sharing recipes. The homepage should feature a waitlist signup form with the following requirements:

- Clean, modern design with a food/cooking theme
- Prominent hero section explaining the recipe sharing platform
- Email signup form for the waitlist
- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
- Use modern React with functional components and hooks
- Include basic styling (CSS or styled-components)
- Add a simple navigation header
- Include placeholder sections for "How it Works" and "Features"

The app should be called "recipe-sharing-app" and be production-ready with proper file structure.
```

### 3. Review the Generated Code

After Claude Code generates the application:

1. Ask Claude Code to install all dependencies and start the application:
   ```
   Install the dependencies for this React app and start it on an available port
   ```
2. Open the newly created `recipe-sharing-app` directory in Cursor or your preferred IDE
3. Explore the file structure and generated components
4. Review the code quality and structure
5. Test the running application in your browser

### 4. Initialize Project Memory

Navigate into your new project directory:

```bash
cd recipe-sharing-app
```

Launch Claude Code and initialize project memory:

```bash
claude
/init
```

This creates a `.claude/` directory with project context that Claude Code will use for future interactions.

### 5. Customize Project Memory

Open the project memory file in Cursor or VS Code to inspect and edit it. The file is typically called `CLAUDE.md` and is located in the project root:

```bash
# Open the project memory file in Cursor
cursor CLAUDE.md

# Or open it in VS Code
code CLAUDE.md
```

Add information like:
- Project purpose and goals
- Key features and functionality
- Code structure and patterns used
- Any specific requirements or constraints

## Expected Outcome

By the end of Step 1, you should have:

âœ… A fully functional React recipe sharing application
âœ… Homepage with working waitlist signup form
âœ… Clean, professional design
âœ… Project initialized with Claude Code memory
âœ… Understanding of the generated code structure

## Next Steps

In Step 2, you'll enhance this application by adding more features and functionality using additional AI coding techniques.

## Tips for Success

- **Be specific** in your prompts to Claude Code
- **Review the generated code** to understand patterns
- **Test frequently** to ensure everything works
- **Ask follow-up questions** if you need modifications
- **Experiment** with different prompt variations

## Troubleshooting

**Claude Code not generating the app?**
- Ensure you're in the correct directory
- Check your authentication status
- Try breaking down the prompt into smaller parts

**Generated app won't start?**
- Run `npm install` in the project directory, or ask Claude Code to install all dependencies
- Check for any error messages in the terminal
- Ensure Node.js is properly installed

**Need to modify the generated code?**
- Use Claude Code's edit capabilities
- Be specific about what you want to change
- Test changes incrementally
